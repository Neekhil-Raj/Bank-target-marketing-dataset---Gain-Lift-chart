## Overview

This project demonstrates how to apply a **logistic regression** model to a real-world **bank marketing dataset** to predict customer response to marketing campaigns. Due to the **low response rate** in such campaigns, it becomes essential to evaluate and optimize the model using tools such as:

- **Gain Chart** ‚Äì to measure how well the model captures actual positive responses.
- **Lift Chart** ‚Äì to compare model effectiveness against random targeting.
- **Decision Tree Visualization** ‚Äì to understand model decision-making behavior.

By identifying the most likely responders, businesses can significantly **reduce marketing costs** while increasing the success rate of campaigns.

---

## Key Concepts

### Gain

> Measures the cumulative proportion of positive responses up to a decile compared to the total positives in the dataset.

**Formula:**

GAIN = (Cumulative positives up to decile i) / (Total positives)


### Lift

> Compares the model‚Äôs performance with a baseline (random) model at each decile.

**Formula:**

LIFT = (Model cumulative positives at decile i) / (Random cumulative positives at decile i)


## Dataset

- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository ‚Äì Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)
- **Description:** Data from Portuguese bank‚Äôs marketing campaigns via phone calls. The task is to predict if a client subscribes to a term deposit.
- **Target Variable:** `y` (yes/no ‚Äì subscription)

## üõ† Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank-target-marketing-gain-lift.git
cd bank-target-marketing-gain-lift
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **(Optional) Set up Graphviz on your system:**

* **Windows:** Install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/) and add its `/bin` path to your environment variables.
* **Linux/macOS:** Use a package manager:

```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt install graphviz

# macOS
brew install graphviz
```

---

## How to Run

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open the notebook file:

```
notebooks/Bank_Marketing_Gain_Lift.ipynb
```

3. Run the cells sequentially to:

   * Load and preprocess the data
   * Train logistic regression & decision tree models
   * Plot Gain and Lift charts
   * Visualize decision tree using Graphviz

---

## Results & Outputs
